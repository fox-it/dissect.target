        At the basis, each disk of a target is represented as a stream of itself. If the target has volumes, these are
        checked to be either encrypted or LVM volumes (if the respective flags are set). If so, that volume is replaced
        in the disk stream with a stream of the volume itself, or removed.

        In the case of encrypted volumes, the encrypted volume is replaced with the decrypted volume. This is done
        transparently on the disk stream level, so the consumer does not need to worry about the decryption process.

        In the case of LVM volumes (including any sort of RAID), the base volumes are removed from the disk stream,
        and a new stream will be yielded for each logical volume. This ensures that no unnecessary scraping is
        performed on base volumes of a logical volume, but only on the reconstructed logical volume.

            encrypted: Whether to replace encrypted volumes for their decrypted counterpart.
            lvm: Whether to skip base volumes of LVM volumes and yield the logical volume itself.
