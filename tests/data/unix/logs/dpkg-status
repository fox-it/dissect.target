Description: scripts for handling many ACPI events
 This package contains scripts to react to various ACPI events. It only
 includes scripts for events that can be supported with some level of
 safety cross platform.
 .
 It is able to:
  * Detect loss and gain of AC power, lid closure, and the press of a
    number of specific buttons (on Asus, IBM, Lenovo, Panasonic, Sony
    and Toshiba laptops).
  * Suspend, hibernate and resume the computer, with workarounds for
    hardware that needs it.
  * On some laptops, set screen brightness.

Description: Advanced Configuration and Power Interface event daemon
 Modern computers support the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI)
 to allow intelligent power management on your system and to query battery and
 configuration status.
 .
 ACPID is a completely flexible, totally extensible daemon for delivering
 ACPI events. It listens on netlink interface (or on the deprecated file
 /proc/acpi/event), and when an event occurs, executes programs to handle the
 event. The programs it executes are configured through a set of configuration
 files, which can be dropped into place by packages or by the admin.

 /etc/deluser.conf 773fb95e98a27947de4a95abb3d3f2a2
Description: add and remove users and groups
 This package includes the 'adduser' and 'deluser' commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
  - 'adduser' creates new users and groups and adds existing users to
    existing groups;
  - 'deluser' removes users and groups and removes users from a given
    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and automate setting
 initial values for the user's password, real name and so on.
 .
 Deluser can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.

 This is InfoZIP's zip program. It produces files that are fully

 options are not identical. In other words, the end result is the same,
 but the methods differ. :-)
